# Oblivious Dynamic Searchable Encryption (ODSE) Framework

This framework contains the basic implementation of three ODSE schemes described in the full paper available on ePrint [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1158). Each ODSE scheme is implemented individually and separately. This project is built on [CodeLite IDE](http://codelite.org). It is recommended to install CodeLite to load the full ODSE workspaces.
